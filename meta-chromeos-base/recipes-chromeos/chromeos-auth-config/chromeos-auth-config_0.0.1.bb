    # Chrome OS: sudo and vt2 are important for system debugging both in
    # developer mode and during development.  These two stanzas allow sudo and
    # login auth as user chronos under the following conditions:
    #
    # 1. password-less access:
    # - system in developer mode
    # - there is no passwd.devmode file
    # - there is no system-wide password set above.
    # 2. System-wide (/etc/shadow) password access:
    # - image has a baked in password above
    # 3. Developer mode password access
    # - user creates a passwd.devmode file with "chronos:CRYPTED_PASSWORD"
    # 4. System-wide (/etc/shadow) password access set by modifying /etc/shadow:
    # - Cases #1 and #2 will apply but failure will fall through to the
    #   inserted password.
